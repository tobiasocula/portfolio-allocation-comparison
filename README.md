### Aim
In this series of Jupyter Notebook files I aim to make a comparison between different approaches of portfolio allocation in finance.

I will be comparing strategies like equal-weights market-cap adjusted weights to simply buying & holding the general market, to see if it is worth opting for these strategies.

I will be choosing multiple different time periods to test these approaches in different scenario's and market regimes, for example, during a bull or bear market or a (longer) overlapping period.

Towards the end of each of these scenario's I make a conclusion and compare the different strategies, and reason why some performed better than others.
